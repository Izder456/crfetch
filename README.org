/a system fetching utility, written in crystal/

** Supported Operating Systems

- Linux
  - (any distro, as long as you can compile crystal code)
- FreeBSD
  - (no issues)
- GhostBSD
  - (no issues)
- OpenBSD
  - (/right now, 7.5-STABLE does not work because lang/crystal/ is broken. On -CURRENT, however, things are fine)
- NetBSD
  - (*untested* as the crystal pkgsrc package is crusty as hell. If/when that is updated, I'll look into this with more scrutiny)
  
** Why another fetching utility?

- *It's fast*

  | Command     | Mean [ms]     | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | ReLative     |
  |-------------+---------------+----------+----------+--------------|
  | =crfetch=     | 23.5 ± 3.8    |     17.3 |     36.2 | 1.00         |
  | =ufetch=      | 77.9 ± 3.2    |     71.6 |     89.0 | 3.32 ± 0.56  |
  | =pfetch=      | 41.9 ± 13.4   |     32.8 |    139.3 | 1.79 ± 0.64  |
  | =screenfetch= | 863.3 ± 125.4 |    771.6 |   1897.3 | 36.80 ± 8.03 |
  | =neofetch=    | 754.6 ± 107.3 |    557.1 |   1313.4 | 32.17 ± 6.95 |

  /tested on a HP Z420 Workstation with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-1607 v2 and 64GB ECC DDR3 RAM running FreeBSD 14.1p2/

- *It's minimal*

  Configuring is done via runtime command switches. You want a config file? Add the switches you want to your shell profile as an alias.

- *It's fun to write crystal*

  IMO, crystal doesn't get enough love (+probably cos the tooling kinda sucks+).
  I also wanted an excuse to learn a new programming language.

* Deps

- Crystal >= 1.12.2
- Shards >= 0.18.0 (usually included with Crystal)
  
* Build/Install

** Build
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ git clone https://github.com/izder456/crfetch
$ cd crfetch
$ shards build --release --static # installs static binary to ./bin/crfetch
$ ./bin/crfetch
#+END_SRC

** Install
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cd crfetch
$ install ./bin/crfetch /path/to/install/destination
#+END_SRC
