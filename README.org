** Why another fetching utility?

- *It's fast*

- *It's minimal*
    Configuring is done via runtime command switches. You want a config file? Add the switches you want to your shell profile as an alias.
- *It's fun to write crystal*
    IMO, crystal doesn't get enough love +probably cos the tooling kinda sucks+, I wanted an excuse to learn a new programming language.

* Deps

- Crystal >= 1.12.2
- Shards >= 0.18.0 (usually included with Crystal)
