/a system fetching utility, written in crystal/


** Supported Operating Systems

- Linux (any distro, as long as you can compile crystal)
- FreeBSD (no issues)
- GhostBSD (no issues)
- OpenBSD (/right now, 7.5-STABLE wont work because lang/crystal/ is broken. on -CURRENT, however things are fine.)
- NetBSD (*untested* as the crystal pkgsrc package is crusty as hell. If/when that is updated, I'll look into this with more scrutiny)
  
** Why another fetching utility?

    - *It's fast*

        | Command     | Mean [ms]    | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative     |
        |-------------+--------------+----------+----------+--------------|
        | =crfetch=     | 49.5 ± 12.7  |     45.2 |    110.4 | 1.00         |
        | =ufetch=      | 83.4 ± 15.6  |     74.8 |    145.2 | 1.68 ± 0.54  |
        | =pfetch=      | 213.3 ± 31.7 |    191.3 |    300.0 | 4.31 ± 1.28  |
        | =neofetch=    | 778.6 ± 31.2 |    719.3 |    825.9 | 15.73 ± 4.09 |
        | =screenfetch= | 983.0 ± 17.4 |    935.4 |   1024.8 | 19.86 ± 5.12 |

    - *It's minimal*

        Configuring is done via runtime command switches. You want a config file? Add the switches you want to your shell profile as an alias.

    - *It's fun to write crystal*

        IMO, crystal doesn't get enough love (+probably cos the tooling kinda sucks+).
        I also wanted an excuse to learn a new programming language.

* Deps

- Crystal >= 1.12.2
- Shards >= 0.18.0 (usually included with Crystal)
  
* Build/Install
