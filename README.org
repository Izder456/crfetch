/a system fetching utility, written in crystal/


** Supported Operating Systems

- Linux
  - (any distro, as long as you can compile crystal code)
- FreeBSD
  - (no issues)
- GhostBSD
  - (no issues)
- OpenBSD
  - (/right now, 7.5-STABLE does not work because lang/crystal/ is broken. On -CURRENT, however, things are fine)
- NetBSD
  - (*untested* as the crystal pkgsrc package is crusty as hell. If/when that is updated, I'll look into this with more scrutiny)
  
** Why another fetching utility?

    - *It's fast*

        | Command       |     Mean [ms] |    Min [ms] |    Max [ms] |      Relative |
        |---------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+---------------|
        | crfetch       |  43.7 ± 10.2  |        36.2 |       105.9 |         1.00  |
        | ufetch        | 101.1 ± 20.7  |        89.5 |       187.7 |  2.31 ± 0.72  |
        | pfetch        | 255.6 ± 30.6  |       226.3 |       342.3 |  5.84 ± 1.53  |
        | screenfetch   | 1222.0 ± 40.3 |      1150.4 |      1354.7 | 27.95 ± 6.56  |
        | neofetch      | 1277.4 ± 33.1 |      1222.4 |      1359.0 | 29.21 ± 6.83  |

        /Recorded on a Panasonic Let's Note CF-NX4 running OpenBSD, with an i5-5300U and 16GB of ram./

    - *It's minimal*

        Configuring is done via runtime command switches. You want a config file? Add the switches you want to your shell profile as an alias.

    - *It's fun to write crystal*

        IMO, crystal doesn't get enough love (+probably cos the tooling kinda sucks+).
        I also wanted an excuse to learn a new programming language.

* Deps

- Crystal >= 1.12.2
- Shards >= 0.18.0 (usually included with Crystal)
  
* Build/Install
